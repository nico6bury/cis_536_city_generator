Fill Space with Irregular Regions (with set number of regions):
Have some sort of grid to represent the possible space (rectangular to make things easier)
For each region to make, randomly place a point on the grid
Now, for each point, claim a random number of adjacent points
Have a small chance to stop claiming if beyond certain percentage size
To keep regions from stretching out too much, have increased chance to select a point which is lower in distance to the center.
